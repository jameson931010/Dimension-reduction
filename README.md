# Architecture
- `main.py`
- Model
	- `cae_model.py`
	- `vcae_model.py`
	- `refiner.py`
	- `hybrid.py`: The refiner that combine transformer and mamba. (Mostly generated by LLM, not tested thoroughly.)
	- `diffusion_model.py`: Diffusion model as refiner
		- To use diffusion as decoder, modify `model_type`.
		- To make training more efficient, reduce the step of inference (and maybe the dimension), since current training method requires the whole inference process during training.
- Auxiliary
	- `dataset.py`: Normalization method can be changed.
	- `plot.py`: Heat-map and channel plot
	- `utils.py`
		- Define the type of refiner.
		- Calculation of scores.
		- Abstraction for getting compressed code/decoding.
		- Fix seed.

# Usage
1. Install the required package `pip install -r requirement.txt`
2. Install the package for mamba properly, I use the one provided by https://github.com/khhungg/MECG-E/tree/main.
3. In `main.py`
	- Choose the refiner to use, and which subset of the data to train.
	- Modify the path of model and the directory to store result.
4. Run `python3 main.py name_of_testing`
